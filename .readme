This code is my first attempt at making a machine learning model accesible through an API. I followed this tutorial to deploy the API https://dev.to/nick_langat/how-to-deploy-a-fastapi-app-to-aws-ec2-server-46d4 
I Check out the App.py file to see how the actual model (the model.pkl) is opened, read, and used by the api. 
By the end, you should be able to use postman and itll work!
